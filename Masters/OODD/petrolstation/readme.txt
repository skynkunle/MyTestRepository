This example demonstartes serveral implementations of the same design of the Petrol station case study.

There are 2 version of the system main menu class.
(1) MainMenu.java class makes use of the KeyboardInput.java class for for console input, and doesn't require java v1.5 to run
(2) MainMenuJava15.java class does not require the KeyboardInput.java class for console input, but require Java 1.5 to run as it uses java.util.Scanner for console input.

The application's classes illustrate the use of array, ArrayList, LinkedList and Hashtable in Java.

Same PetrolStationADT is implemented in 4 different ways, using different data structure, viz.  array, ArrayList, LinkedList and Hashtable.

It shows how to add, remove, get an element, and traverse the elements of a collection of objects in an  array, ArrayList, LinkedList or Hashtable.

The application user-interface that uses the same PetrolStationADT does not have to change, no matter of which implementation of the ADT is used at runtime.
